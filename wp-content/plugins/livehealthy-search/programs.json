Because cycling is low-impact cardio exercise, it is often recommended after surgery, but unfortunately, poor form or fit can lead to new injuries.\r\n\r\nPain or numbness in any part of your body, but especially in the neck, low back or knees, may indicate a poor bike fit.  Other symptoms can include:\r\n\r\nPain on the inside or outside of the knee or along the IT band\r\nNumb buttock(s)\r\nSore Achilles tendon(s)\r\nSliding forward or backward on the saddle; saddle sores\r\nPain in the ball of your foot\r\nWe will evaluate your body’s position relative to the handlebars, pedals and saddle. If you have to reach too far to grasp the handlebars, for instance, the bike’s stem length and angle may need correction.\r\n\r\nProper fitting can improve handling, leverage and pedaling force.

Home exercises, at an appropriate pace, are an important part of treatment. Your plan will also usually include a progressive fitness program to improve overall energy and wellness.

InjuryFree is also contracted to provide wellness program services to Community Transit employees. This more tightly integrates the EMC with wellness and prevention services, providing coordinated support for workplace health and wellness.\r\n\r\nThe EMC has been in operation for nearly two years and is well-utilized and popular across all employee work groups. Metrics are being tracked for cost-effectiveness, utilization, and decreases in workers' compensation and absenteeism.","City__c":"Everett","Address__c":"7100 Hardeson Road","Postal_Code__c":"98155","Organization_Name__c":"Community Transit","Program_Type__c":"Increase activity","Id":"a0161000002DJ8OAAW","Account__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Account","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Account/00161000008Q9D2AAK"},"Id":"00161000008Q9D2AAK","Name":"Community Transit"}},{"attributes":{"type":"Program__c","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Program__c/a0161000004zMDpAAM"},"Name":"Mariner HS Career Ambassadors","Do_you_serve__c":"Female;Male;Gender Fluid","Account__c":"00161000008Q9CwAAK","What_ages_do_you_reach__c":"Teen (11-18);Young Adults (19-25)","LH2020_Does_your_program_serve__c":"Open to all (general community)","Program_Focus__c":"Other","Program_Objective__c":"Other, please describe below","Sub_community_or_ethnic_group_reach__c":"Open to all (general community)","Program_Name__c":"Mariner HS Career Ambassadors","State__c":"WA","Description__c":"Expose graduating seniors to a manufacturing career w/Campbells StockPot","City__c":"Everett","Address__c":"200 120th St SW","Postal_Code__c":"98204","Organization_Name__c":"Campbell's Fresh","Other_Program_Objectives__c":"Provide access and opportunities for careers in the food production industry","Program_Type__c":"Both Activity/Nutrition","Id":"a0161000004zMDpAAM","Account__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Account","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Account/00161000008Q9CwAAK"},"Id":"00161000008Q9CwAAK","Name":"Campbell's Fresh"}},{"attributes":{"type":"Program__c","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Program__c/a016100000507VsAAI"},"Name":"Respecting Choices Class","Account__c":"001610000096phaAAA","Program_Focus__c":"Other","Program_Objective__c":"Other, please describe below","Program_Name__c":"Respecting Choices Class","State__c":"WA","Description__c":"This is a free, two-hour community class being held at YMCA Mill Creek.

The link between poverty and homelessness and poor health outcomes are well-documented. Tomorrow's Hope provides early intervention to give children and their parents an opportunity to set their feet on the path to healthy living. There are several current health interventions in place with a goal of expanding these services.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN'S HEALTH CLINIC\r\n\r\nAn infant health nurse comes in monthly to visit our infant room. She provides routine checkups to ensure the children are at an ideal weight for their age, that their shots are up-to-date, and to identify any health concerns. Parents are able to opt-in or out of this service. Those who opt-in are notified of concerns and progress.\r\n\r\nCommunity Health Center visits Tomorrow's Hope weekly to provide check-ups, minor prescriptions for issues like an ear infection, and give shots. This service is optional and the majority of parents utilize this service due to its convenience and numerous benefits it provides. \r\n\r\n\r\nCHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTomorrow's Hope administers several programs that provide nutrition education and healthy food to children including the Fresh Organic Fruit and Vegetable Program, Children's Gardening Program, and Breakfast, Lunch, and Snack Program. \r\n\r\nThe Fresh Organic Fruit and Vegetable Program has been an important tool in our efforts to combat childhood obesity. The program has been successful in introducing children to a variety of produce that they otherwise might not have the opportunity to sample.\r\n\r\nThe Children's Gardening Program has been a hands-on introduction to the fun of planting, tending, and harvesting fresh produce and ultimately preparing and tasting the fruits of their labor. Garden activities are unique to each class and allows teachers to get creative in what they want to teach and how best to engage their particular age group. \r\n\r\nThe Breakfast, Lunch, and Snack Program provides nutritionally balanced, free meals to approximately 112 children each day. Tomorrow's Hope adheres to USDA guidelines. Tomorrow's Hope has minimized processed, canned, and frozen food to optimize nutrition. Children are introduced to non-conventional food items like fish and variety of ethnic meals. \r\n\r\nAs children learn and grow into the Child Nutrition Program, parents are encouraged to participate and engage their children at home with nutrition and food. Tomorrow's Hope has a \"Cooks Corner\" bulletin board to educate parents on what the USDA program entails, it provides nutrition tips, recipe ideas, a blank weekly menu for home, and other relevant information.","City__c":"Everett","Address__c":"5910 Evergreen Way","Postal_Code__c":"98203","Organization_Name__c":"Housing Hope","Program_Type__c":"Both Activity/Nutrition","Id":"a0161000009LvANAA0","Account__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Account","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Account/00161000008Q9DMAA0"},"Id":"00161000008Q9DMAA0","Name":"Housing Hope"}},{"attributes":{"type":"Program__c","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Program__c/a0161000009LvZaAAK"},"Name":"Homeless Family Services","Do_you_serve__c":"Female;Male;Gender Fluid","Account__c":"00161000008Q9DMAA0","What_ages_do_you_reach__c":"Children (0-5);Youth (6-10);Teen (11-18);Young Adults (19-25);Adult (26-59);Seniors (60+)","LH2020_Does_your_program_serve__c":"Single adult;Single adult with children;Multiple adults with children","Program_Focus__c":"Child nutrition;Emergency food access;Farmers markets/community gardens;Youth activity programs;Adult activity programs;Health education","Program_Objective__c":"Reducing food insecurity;Promoting a balanced diet;Promoting a healthy weight;Reducing sedentary behavior;Increasing youth activity;Increasing adult activity;Capacity Building","Sub_community_or_ethnic_group_reach__c":"Open to all (general community);People with diverse abilities","Description__c":"Housing Hope's Homeless Family Services Program is the agency's foundational program, combining safe, stable and affordable housing with comprehensive tailored services to empower homeless and low-income families to achieve self-sufficiency and ultimately escape poverty. \r\n\r\nMany of our families come into the program with a variety of health and wellness difficulties ranging from diabetes, obesity, and food insecurity. With parents struggling to secure housing, employment and/or education, and take care of their children's needs, health is not always a priority. However, once stabilized, families are able to focus on their health and begin building a path of a more active and healthy lifestyle. \r\n\r\nFamily Support Coaches help families identify unmet needs and work to address those needs with community connections including food banks, community health centers, local gyms with financial assistance programs, and our very own College of Hope Health and Wellness courses. Residents in our program have access to a food pantry when emergencies arise. In addition, many housing sites have a community garden and it has become customary to include a garden in all new housing developments. With the help of a Family Support Coach, residents have full control of what produce is planted, who tends to the garden, and how it is divided. A Master Gardener may be invited to help participants decide the best produce to plant, strategies for an optimal gardening experience, and recipes tailored to the gardens’ produce.\r\n\r\nHousing Hope anticipates and is excited to continue growing a health program tailored to Homeless Family Services. With the expanding of community partnerships in the health industry and seeking evidenced-based practices, we anticipate increased health and wellness services that will provide myriad of benefits to our participants.","City__c":"Everett","Address__c":"5830 Evergreen Way","Postal_Code__c":"98203","Organization_Name__c":"Housing Hope","Program_Type__c":"Both Activity/Nutrition","Id":"a0161000009LvZaAAK","Account__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Account","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Account/00161000008Q9DMAA0"},"Id":"00161000008Q9DMAA0","Name":"Housing Hope"}},{"attributes":{"type":"Program__c","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Program__c/a0161000009Lz9WAAS"},"Name":"Water Bottle Filling Station","Do_you_serve__c":"Female;Male","Account__c":"001610000096phUAAQ","What_ages_do_you_reach__c":"Youth (6-10);Teen (11-18)","LH2020_Does_your_program_serve__c":"Open to all (general community)","Program_Focus__c":"Child nutrition","Program_Objective__c":"Other, please describe below","Sub_community_or_ethnic_group_reach__c":"Open to all (general community)","Description__c":"We have added a water bottle filling station in each of our schools.","City__c":"Sultan","Address__c":"514 4th Street","Postal_Code__c":"98294","Organization_Name__c":"Sultan School District","Other_Program_Objectives__c":"Provide an alternative to soda and drinks with sugar.

This program provides Health and Wellness courses that help participants prepare healthy and cost efficient meals tailored to their particular health circumstances.  In addition, free transportation, free on-site childcare, and a free family-style meal are offered in order to remove the most common barriers to class participation. \r\n\r\nMany homeless and low-income individuals did not have childhoods that prepared them to be self-sufficient in routinely completing adult tasks including nutritious food preparation, budgeting, housekeeping, and other family routines.   These adults and their children are at high-risk for poor life outcomes including poverty, poor health and homelessness.  Furthermore, these challenges have broader implications for the overall health and well-being of the greater community in which they live. \r\n\r\nOne of the greatest participant needs is for increased knowledge and skills with budgeting for groceries, meal planning and providing nutritious meals.  Many program participants struggle with multiple chronic health issues including diabetes, hypertension and food allergies and are in need of quality education on health and nutritious meal planning that accommodates these restrictions and works with their limited budgets.  Participants also typically request help with label reading, portion sizing, increasing fruits and vegetables and learning how to effectively cut costs without cutting nutritional value.  \r\n\r\nCollege of Hope Health and Wellness courses address these issues with structured, evidenced based curriculum designed to improve participants’ health throughout their lifetime.  This well-established program has proven to be a vital resource for homeless and low-income families through the county.

The theme this year is Your Health, Your Coverage, Your Choices.  The Ethnic Elder Fair typically draws over 25 exhibitors and vendors to the event and offers your business or agency a unique opportunity to meet and provide information to older adults. You will have the opportunity to work with ethnic groups who speak Vietnamese, Tagalog, Mandarin, Russian, Nepali, Korean, Spanish, and Ukrainian. During the event the elders are even given a tour of the exhibitors in their native language!\r\n\r\nThe Ethnic Elder Resource Fair has proven to be a successful model that improves access to services for the growing diverse older adult population.  This event typically draws 300-400 participants each year!  During past events we have assisted seniors with signing up for Medicare Part D, cooking demonstrations, health education workshops, and health screenings.  Participants who had a health screening and were identified as needing a consultation with a health care professional will receive a follow up call from our bilingual staff at Senior Services of Snohomish County.","City__c":"Lynnwood","Address__c":"Edmonds Community College\r\n20000 68th Ave W","Postal_Code__c":"98036","Organization_Name__c":"Homage Senior Services","Other_Program_Objectives__c":"Help increase health knowledge across cultures and languages","Program_Type__c":"Increase activity","Id":"a0161000008VUGpAAO","Account__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Account","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Account/00161000008Q9DaAAK"},"Id":"00161000008Q9DaAAK","Name":"Homage Senior Services"}},{"attributes":{"type":"Program__c","url":"/services/data/v40.0/sobjects/Program__c/a0161000008VV6kAAG"},"Name":"Waterfront Place","Do_you_serve__c":"Female;Male;Gender Fluid","Account__c":"0016100000U1NIlAAN","What_ages_do_you_reach__c":"Children (0-5);Youth (6-10);Teen (11-18);Young Adults (19-25);Adult (26-59);Seniors (60+)","LH2020_Does_your_program_serve__c":"Open to all (general community)","Program_Focus__c":"Youth activity programs;Adult activity programs;Employee wellness;Health education;Other","Program_Objective__c":"Reducing sedentary behavior;Increasing youth activity;Increasing adult activity;Other, please describe below;Capacity Building","Sub_community_or_ethnic_group_reach__c":"Open to all (general community)","Description__c":"Adding additional parks, trails and public spaces to the Waterfront Place development.","City__c":"Everett","Address__c":"1205 Craftsman Way, Suite 200","Postal_Code__c":"WA","Organization_Name__c":"Port of Everett","Other_Program_Objectives__c":"The Port's Waterfront Place development is designed to create a liveable community that combines the lifestyle options for enjoying the marina waterfront with trails and parks, while being close to both housing and work options.
